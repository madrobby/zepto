## Code style guidelines

* `function name() { }` for named functions
* `function(){ }` for anonymous functions
* No curly braces for single-line control flow statements such as `if` & friends
* Don't write [semicolons that are optional][optional]
* Put a single semicolon _before_ statements that start with `(` or `[`
  (see above article as for why it's needed)
* Use long, descriptive variable and method names
* Use blank lines to separate "paragraphs" of code for readability
* Use comments to describe non-obvious code behavior
